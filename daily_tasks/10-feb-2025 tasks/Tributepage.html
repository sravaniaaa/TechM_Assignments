                Ratan Tata: A Legacy of Leadership and Humanity
                Ratan Tata is more than just a businessman‚Äîhe is a beacon of integrity, resilience, and generosity. As the former chairman of the Tata Group, he transformed the company into a global powerhouse, all while upholding ethics, compassion, and a deep commitment to India‚Äôs progress.
                Under his leadership, the Tata Group launched groundbreaking ventures like the Tata Nano, making car ownership accessible to the common man, and acquired iconic brands such as Jaguar Land Rover, showcasing India's prowess on the world stage.

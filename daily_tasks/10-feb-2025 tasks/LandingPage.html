        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <div class="about">
            <p>ShopEase is dedicated to bringing you the best products at affordable prices.Kindness is at the heart of everything we do – 
                but – we’re about so much more. With the aim of creating skincare that is fuss-free and approachable, we’re committed to keeping
                 you and your skin looking (and feeling!) its best, starting with clean, uncomplicated products that downright love your skin and 
                 the planet too.
                What is clean beauty, you ask? It is saying a big NO to baddies such as perfume/fragrance, colours, etc known to upset your skin,
                 because what we leave out is just as important as what we put in.
                What’s even more amazing is that Simple has been in the clean beauty game way before it was cool! 
                Our journey started way back in the 1960’s, in the hands of a British doctor, with the goal of offering kindness to sensitive skins. With 1978 marking the launch of our first ever no colour, no perfume and no harsh chemicals soap, our attitude towards skincare is still the same! Our products today are still made with no colours or dyes, perfumes or harsh chemicals that can upset your skin. Meaning your skin will love us, always.
                Our free-from list boasts more than 2000 harsh chemicals that are harmful to your skin! But we don’t stop there, we are committed to clean beauty and for that, every year 10% of our profits go towards R&D. These efforts are to further work on our free-from list and increase the number of blacklisted ingredients. Oh yes, we take a lot of pride in this ever-increasing list!  </p>
